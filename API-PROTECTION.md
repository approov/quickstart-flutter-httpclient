# API Protection
You should use this option if you wish to protect access to your APIs using an Approov token. We recommend this approach where it is possible to modify the backend API implementation to perform the token verification. Various [Backend API Quickstarts](https://approov.io/docs/latest/approov-integration-examples/backend-api/) are available to suit your particular situation depending on the backend technology used. You will need to implement this in addition to the steps in this frontend guide.

These steps require access to the [Approov CLI](https://approov.io/docs/latest/approov-cli-tool-reference/), please follow the [Installation](https://approov.io/docs/latest/approov-installation/) instructions.

## ADDING API DOMAINS
In order for Approov tokens to be added by the interceptor for particular API domains it is necessary to inform Approov about them. Execute the following command:

```
approov api -add your.domain
```
Approov tokens will then be added automatically to any requests to that domain (using the `Approov-Token` header, by default).

Note that this will also add a public key certicate pin for connections to the domain to ensure that no Man-in-the-Middle attacks on your app's communication are possible. Please read [Managing Pins](https://approov.io/docs/latest/approov-usage-documentation/#public-key-pinning-configuration) to understand this in more detail.

## REGISTERING APPS
In order for Approov to recognize the app as being valid it needs to be registered with the service. Change directory to the top level of your app project and then register the app with Approov:

For Android:

```
$ approov registration -add build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-debug.apk
```

For iOS it is necessary to explicitly build an `.ipa` using the command `flutter build ipa`. This will provide the path of the `.ipa` that you can then register, e.g:

```
$ approov registration -add build/ios/ipa/YourApp.ipa
```

Remember if you are using bitcode then you must also use the `-bitcode` option with the registration.

> **IMPORTANT:** The registration takes about 30 seconds to propagate across the Approov Cloud Infrastructure, therefore don't try to run the app again before this time has elapsed. During development of your app you can ensure the device [always passes](https://approov.io/docs/latest/approov-usage-documentation/#adding-a-device-security-policy) so you do not have to register the APK each time you modify it.

[Managing Registrations](https://approov.io/docs/latest/approov-usage-documentation/#managing-registrations) provides more details for app registrations, especially for releases to the Play Store. Note that you may also need to apply specific [Android Obfuscation](https://approov.io/docs/latest/approov-usage-documentation/#android-obfuscation) rules for your app when releasing it.

## FURTHER OPTIONS
See [Exploring Other Approov Features](https://approov.io/docs/latest/approov-usage-documentation/#exploring-other-approov-features) for information about additional Approov features you may wish to try.

### Changing Approov Token Header Name
The default header name of `Approov-Token` can be changed as follows:

```Dart
ApproovService.setApproovHeader("Authorization", "Bearer ")
```

The first parameter is the new header name and the second a prefix to be added to the Approov token. This is primarily for integrations where the Approov Token JWT might need to be prefixed with `Bearer` and passed in the `Authorization` header.

### Token Binding
If want to use [Token Binding](https://approov.io/docs/latest/approov-usage-documentation/#token-binding) then set the header holding the value to be used for binding as follows:

```Dart
ApproovService.setBindingHeader("Authorization")
```

In this case it means that the value of `Authorization` holds the token value to be bound. This only needs to be called once. On subsequent requests the value of the specified header is read and its value set as the token binding value. Note that you should only select a header that is normally always present and the value does not typically change from request to request, as each change requires a new Approov token to be fetched.

### Prefetching
If you wish to reduce the latency associated with fetching the first Approov token, then construct an `ApproovClient` soon after app initialization (to provide the configuration string) and then call:

```Dart
ApproovService.prefetch()
```

This initiates the process of fetching an Approov token as a background task, so that a cached token is available immediately when subsequently needed, or at least the fetch time is reduced. Note that there is no point in performing a prefetch if you are using token binding.

### Prechecking
You may wish to do an early check in your app to present a warning to the user if it is not going to be able to obtain valid Approov tokens because it fails the attestation process. To do this you first need to enable the [Secure Strings](https://approov.io/docs/latest/approov-usage-documentation/#secure-strings) feature:

```
approov secstrings -setEnabled
```

> Note that this command requires an [admin role](https://approov.io/docs/latest/approov-usage-documentation/#account-access-roles).

Here is an example of calling the appropriate method in `ApproovService`:

```Dart
try {
    await ApproovService.precheck();
}
on ApproovRejectionException catch(e) {
    // failure due to the attestation being rejected, e.arc and e.rejectionReasons may be used to present information to the user
    // (note e.rejectionReasons is only available if the feature is enabled, otherwise it is always an empty string)
}
on ApproovNetworkException catch(e) {
    // failure due to a potentially temporary networking issue, allow for a user initiated retry
}
on ApproovException catch(e) {
   // a more permanent error, see e.cause
}
// app has passed the precheck
```

> Note you should NEVER use this as the only form of protection in your app, this is simply to provide an early indication of failure to your users as a convenience. You must always also have APIs protected with Approov tokens that are essential to the operation of your app. This is because, although the Approov attestation itself is heavily secured, it may be possible for an attacker to bypass its result or prevent it being called at all.

If you wish to provide more direct feedback with the [Rejection Reasons](https://approov.io/docs/latest/approov-usage-documentation/#rejection-reasons) feature use:

```
approov policy -setRejectionReasons on
```

> Note that this command requires an [admin role](https://approov.io/docs/latest/approov-usage-documentation/#account-access-roles).
